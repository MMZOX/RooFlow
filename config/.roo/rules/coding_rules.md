# Coding Rules for Agents

## Complete Implementation Requirements

1. **No Placeholders or TODOs**
   - Always implement full, complete functionality as requested
   - Never use placeholder comments like `// TODO` or `# Implement later`
   - Never leave stub methods or functions that return dummy values
   - If a feature is complex, break it down into manageable parts but implement each part fully

2. **Comprehensive Error Handling**
   - Implement proper error handling for all code
   - Account for edge cases and unexpected inputs
   - Use appropriate exception handling mechanisms for the language
   - Validate all inputs and provide meaningful error messages

3. **Complete Documentation**
   - Document all functions, methods, and classes with clear descriptions
   - Include parameter descriptions and return value information
   - Document any assumptions or limitations
   - Add inline comments for complex logic

## Testing Requirements

1. **Mandatory Testing**
   - All code implementations MUST be tested before being considered complete
   - Write appropriate unit tests for all new functionality
   - Ensure tests cover both normal operation and edge cases
   - Verify that tests pass before submitting the implementation

2. **Test-Driven Development**
   - Consider writing tests before implementing the functionality
   - Use tests to validate that the implementation meets requirements
   - Update tests as requirements evolve

3. **Test Coverage**
   - Aim for high test coverage of all code paths
   - Test both success and failure scenarios
   - Include integration tests for components that interact with each other
   - Test performance characteristics when relevant

4. **Test Execution**
   - Always run tests after implementing or modifying code
   - Fix any failing tests before considering the task complete
   - Document the test execution process and results

## Implementation Process

1. **Understand Requirements Fully**
   - Before coding, ensure complete understanding of the requirements
   - Ask clarifying questions if any aspect is unclear
   - Consider edge cases and potential issues before implementation

2. **Design Before Coding**
   - Create a clear design or plan before writing code
   - Consider architecture, patterns, and best practices
   - Think about maintainability and extensibility

3. **Incremental Implementation**
   - Implement functionality incrementally, testing each increment
   - Refactor as needed to maintain code quality
   - Commit changes at logical points with clear messages

4. **Code Quality Standards**
   - Follow language-specific best practices and conventions
   - Maintain consistent coding style
   - Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
   - Optimize for readability first, then performance

## Verification Checklist

Before considering any coding task complete, verify that:

- [ ] All requested functionality is fully implemented (no placeholders)
- [ ] Comprehensive tests have been written
- [ ] All tests pass successfully
- [ ] Code is well-documented
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive
- [ ] Code follows best practices and conventions
- [ ] Edge cases have been considered and handled
- [ ] The implementation is efficient and performant
- [ ] The code is readable and maintainable

## Using MCP Servers

- Leverage MCP servers for gathering information about best practices
- Use MCP servers to validate implementation approaches
- Utilize MCP servers for testing and verification when appropriate
- Consult MCP servers for error resolution during development
